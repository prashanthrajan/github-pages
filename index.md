Currently taking **CSE** ~~220~~ *110*

Hello! My name is Prashanth Rajan.  
I am from the Bay Area. I recently declared **Economics** as a second major after taking some econ classes as a breadth requirement. I play tennis for fun and also enjoy swimming. I like solving coding problems (although I feel like I should spend a lot more time doing this). I am home at the moment but am really excited to come back to San Diego in fall quarter. I hope I *spend more time at the beach* and ***learn to surf***.

### Tennis

***I like to watch and play tennis.***<br>
**My favorite player is _Roger Federer_ from Switzerland**.

### Disney
I love Disney (and Pixar) movies.  
Some of my favorite Disney movies are:
* Tangled
* Toy Story
* Robin Hood
I like this Walt Disney quotation:
>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.

### Bash Script

I like to use the `diff` command to double check my results with the expected results.

Although I am not very good at it, I think bash script is fun and useful.
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "bash script is cool!"
```
